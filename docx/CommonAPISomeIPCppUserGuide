== Introduction

=== Aim of this document

This document complements the CommonAPI tutorial with D-Bus specific information. Please read the base tutorial first.

== Integration Guide for CommonAPI users

The following descriptions assume that host and target platform are Linux platforms. However CommonAPI SOME/IP also supports Windows as host and target platform. All you need to know for Windows concerning CommonAPI you find in the separate Windows paragraph below at the end of this Integration Guide.

=== Requirements

CommonAPI was developed for GENIVI and will run on most Linux platforms. Additionally it is possible to run it under Windows for test and development purposes. Please note:

- CommonAPI uses a lot of C++11 features, as variadic templates, std::bind, std::function and so on. Make sure that the compiler of your target platform is able to compile it (e.g. gcc 4.8).
- The build system of CommonAPI is CMake; please make sure that it is installed on your host.
- Do not use earlier versions of Eclipse as Luna; it could work but there is no warranty.
- The build tool chain for the code generators is Maven; make sure that at least Maven 3 is available. If you use eclipse make sure that the maven plug-in is installed.

The CommonAPI SOME/IP binding requires the SOME/IP implementation vsomeip.

==== Command-line

In order to build the CommonAPI SOME/IP Runtime library the vsomeip library must be available on your system. Please consult the vsomeip documentation for informations on building vsomeip.

Now use CMake to build the CommonAPI SOME/IP runtime library. We assume that your source directory is +common-api-someip-runtime+:

----
$ cd common-api-someip-runtime
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -D USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ make install
----

You can change the installation directory by the CMake variable +CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX+ or you can let it uninstalled (skip the +make install+ command). If you want to use the uninstalled version of CommonAPI set the CMake variable USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI to OFF.

This is the standard procedure and will hopefully create the shared CommonAPI D-Bus runtime library libCommonAPI-DBus.so in the build directory. Note that CMake checks if doxygen and asciidoc are installed. These tools are only necessary if you want to generate the documentation of your own. The unit tests of CommonAPI D-Bus are implemented by using the Google C++ Testing Framework. If you want to build and run the unit tests the environment variable +GTEST_ROOT+ must point to the correct directory (see the contributor's guide below). 

There are several options for calling CMake and make targets.

Generate makefile for building a static CommonAPI library (default is a shared library). The library will be in _/build/src/CommonAPI/someip_.
----
$ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..
----

Generate makefile for building the release version of CommonAPI SOME/IP (default is debug).
----
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
----

Without any further settings +make install+ will copy CommonAPI SOME/IP libraries and header files to _/usr/local_. You can change this destination directory by changing the installation prefix (e.g. to test).
----
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/test  ..
----

Make targets:

[width="80%",cols="4,10"]
|=========================================================

|+make all+ |
Same as make. Will compile and link CommonAPI.

|+make clean+ |
Deletes binaries, but not the files which has been generated by CMake.

|+make maintainer-clean+ |
Deletes everything in the build directory.

|+make install+ |
Copies libraries to _/user/local/lib/commonapiX.X.X_ and header files to _/user/local/include/commonapiX.X.X/CommonAPI_.

|+make DESTDIR=< install_dir > install+ |
The destination directory for the installation can be influenced by +DESTDIR+. 

|=========================================================

Further make targets will be described in the contributor's guide below.

==== Eclipse

Follow the instructions in the CommonAPI User Guide.

=== Compile tools

Like the CommonAPI core code generators you can build the SOME/IP generator by calling maven from the command-line. Open a console and change in the directory org.genivi.commonapi.someip.releng of your CommonAPI-Tools directory. Then call:

----
mvn -Dtarget.id=org.genivi.commonapi.someip.target clean verify
----

After the successful build you will find the commond-line generators archived in org.genivi.commonapi.someip.cli.product/target/products/commonapi-generator.zip and the update-sites in org.genivi.commonapi.someip.updatesite/target.

=== Build Glue Code

The glue code library contains the binding specific, generated code. It depends on your specific project how exactly this library is built (with or without skeleton code, divided up into several libraries, e.g. for services and clients, and so on). The glue code for the verification tests can be built by means of the binding specific verification project (for SOME/IP it is _org.genivi.commonapi.someip.verification_ in CommonAPI-SomeIP-Tools):

. Generate CommonAPI code for all requested fidl files using the code generator. The fidl files for the verification tests can be found in _org.genivi.commonapi.core.verification/fidl_.
. Create a build directory for an out of source build.
. Call cmake as described below with additional parameters (in eclipse create a make target).

CMake parameters:

[width="90%",cols="5,10"]
|=========================================================

|+USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI+ |
ON or OFF

|+BINDING_NAME+ |
DBus or SomeIP

|+CMAKE_BINDING_NAME+ |
e.g. CommonAPI-SomeIP

|+CMAKE_BINDING_PATH+ |
Path to the build directory of your CommonAPI binding (e.g. CommonAPI-SomeIP/build) 

|+CMAKE_GLUECODE_NAME+ |
Name of the glue code library, e.g. SomeIpGlue

|+CMAKE_GLUECODE_PATH+ |
Path to the glue code library

|+BINDING_EXTRA+ |
Additional library which is necessary for the build process, e.g. libvsomeip-1.so

|+COMMONAPI_CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH+ |
Path to the build directory of CommonAPI (e.g. CommonAPI/build)

|+COMMONAPI_SOMEIP_TOOL_GENERATOR+ |
Code generator executable with path

|=========================================================

 
Example:

----
cmake -DUSE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=OFF -DBINDING_NAME=someip -DCMAKE_BINDING_NAME=CommonAPI-SomeIP -DCMAKE_BINDING_PATH=myworkpath/CommonAPI-SomeIP/build -DCMAKE_GLUECODE_NAME=SomeIPGlue -DCMAKE_GLUECODE_PATH=myworkpath/CommonAPI-SomeIP-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.someip.verification/build -DBINDING_EXTRA=/usr/local/lib/libvsomeip.so -DCOMMONAPI_CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH=myworkpath/CommonAPI/build -DCOMMONAPI_SOMEIP_TOOL_GENERATOR=myworkpath/CommonAPI-SomeIP-Tools/org.genivi.commonapi.someip.cli.product/target/products/org.genivi.commonapi.someip.cli.product/linux/gtk/x86/commonapi_someip_generator ..
----

=== Project Setup

==== Configuration

CommonAPI-SomeIP can be configured as CommonAPI itself by an ini-file. The default name of this configuration file is +commonapi-someip.ini+. There are three places where CommonAPI-SomeIP Runtime tries to find this file (in the following order):

1. in the directory of the current executable. If there is a +commonapi-someip.ini+ file, it has the highest priority.
2. in the directory which is specified by the environment variable +COMMONAPI_SOMEIP_DEFAULT_CONFIG+.
3. in the global default directory +/etc+.

The configuration file has 2 possible kinds of sections; all sections are optional.

===== Address Translation Sections

This kind of section determines how CommonAPI addresses are translated into SOME/IP addresses (service identifier and instance identifier). The name of the section is the CommonAPI address and the parameters are: 

- +service+
- +instance+

Example:

----
[local:de.ABC:de.app1]
service=0x1234
instance=0x5678
----

==== Deployment

As there is no predefined translation of CommonAPI addresses to SOME/IP addresses, you need to specify translations for the service instances you want to use.
The same is true for all methods identifier, event identifiers and attribute getter and setter method identifiers. Thus, for each interface you need to 
specifiy the SOME/IP service identifier:

[source,java]
----
import "platform:/plugin/org.genivi.commonapi.core/deployment/CommonAPI-SOMEIP_deployment_spec.fdepl"

define org.genivi.commonapi.someip.deployment for interface <CommonAPI interface name> {
	SomeIpServiceID = <id>

	method <CommonAPI method name> {
		SomeIpMethodID = <id>
	}

	attribute <CommonAPI method name> {
		SomeIpGetterID = <id>
		SomeIpSetterID = <id>
		SomeIpNotifierID = <id>
		// All these ID settings are optional, but you need to specify at least one
		// if you specify a SomeIpNotifierID you also need to specify an eventgroup
		SomeIpEventGroups = { <id> }
	}
}

define org.genivi.commonapi.someip.deployment for provider <Name> {
	instance <CommonAPI interface name> {
		InstanceId = <CommonAPI instance name>
		SomeIpInstanceID = <id>
	}
}
----

The easiest way to define a complete deployment is to use the "auto-complete" function of the Eclipse editor for .fidl/.fdepl files. It will insert all
mandatory elements and you only need to provide the settings for them.


=== Windows

==== Build vsomeip

You need to start with building boost 1.54 or higher (at least the log, system and thread libraries). Then execute within the vsomeip source directory:

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..

to create a Visual Studio 2013 solution. Finally, open the solution, adapt the pathes to boost and build vsomeip.

==== Build CommonAPI

Execute within the CommonAPI source directory:

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..

to create a Visual Studio 2013 solution. Finally, open the solution and build CommonAPI.

==== Build CommonAPI-SomeIP

Execute within the CommonAPI-SomeIP source directory:

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..

to create a Visual Studio 2013 solution. Finally, open the solution and build CommonAPI.
