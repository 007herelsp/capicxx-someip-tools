Changes
=======

v3.1.10
- Upgrade to JDK-1.8.
- Explicitely set visibility for the deployments to enable linkage after compilation with -fvisibility=hidden.
- Added new deployment parameter CRCWidth for attributes, broadcasts and methods.
- Added config file to run tests with security. All clients are allowed to do everything and "credentials" (uid/gid) may need to be adjusted in order to run tests on different platforms depending on which user/group the tests started from.
- Added filter in validator to avoid validation of interfaces deployed for the core or dbus.
